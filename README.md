# error-bars
Parses CSV data (in a rather hamfisted way, throwing away errors for now) using lovasoa/elm-csv, then displays it using terezka/line-charts.  Also displays non-plotted data as tooltips that retain proximity to the charted data point.  

This project exists mostly to share how error bars could be implemented using terezka/line-charts.
